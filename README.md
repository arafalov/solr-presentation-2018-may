# Rapid Solr Schema Development (Phone directory)
This repository is backing the Solr presentation given in May 2018 at Montreal Solr/ML meetup.
The presentation slides are at: https://www.slideshare.net/arafalov/rapid-solr-schema-development-phone-directory
The commit sequence - mostly - follows the slides, making it easy to use the configuration from any particular step.
